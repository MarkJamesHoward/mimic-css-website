## Design System

In order to provide consistency across your website we provide a set of standard values that can be used rather than specific pixel values.

There are 6 values that are used across the board **xs, sm, md, lg, xl and 2xl**

```html
<div class="padding-top:md">Some Text</div>
```

**becomes**

```css
.padding-top\:md {
  padding-top: 8px;
}
```
